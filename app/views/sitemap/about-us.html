                    Sometimes hosting an event is more stress than not. You probably would have preferred to be in
                    your pyjamas all day watching that episode on Netflix that you fell asleep to last week. Event Bid
                    wants to give you that feeling of popping a bottle of champagne, laughing with friends, eating too
                    much and sore feet from standing too long. Let someone else do all the work for you and be the
                    guest at your own party. Event Bid believes that you can truly have your cake and eat it too.<br /><br />
                    <b style="font-size:18px">“Love what you do, do what you love”</b><br />
                    Do you have that side hustle you love?
                    Is it for a bit of extra cash on the side?
                    Do you do it just because you love it?
                    Or are you trying to eventually quit your 9-5?<br /><br />
                    Whatever it may be, you should share your skills and your passions with those who actually need it.
                    We want to help support your business and nurture your talents. We understand that it’s hard to
                    spend time and money marketing yourself to get those jobs, we want to do all that for you. Let the
                    jobs come to you and all you have to do is put your hand up for it. We want you to be able to do
                    what you love and love what you do.
